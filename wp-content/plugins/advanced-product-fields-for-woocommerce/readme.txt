= Limitations of the free version =
Our free version is great for small stores or stores that don't need to add many (complex) options to their products.
There are two main drawbacks of the free version that you should be aware about:

* The free version does not integrate with 3rd party plugins such as WooCommerce Subscriptions or a multi-currency plugin.
* The free version does not work with themes using Ajax for their product "add to cart".

If you need those aspects, you may need our premium version. You can read ahead what's included with premium.

= Premium Features =

Everything from the free version, plus:

* More field types:
  * **File upload** - allowing your customers to upload (multiple) files.
  * **Image swatches** - multi and single choice options with images.
  * **Color swatches** - multi and single color options.
  * **Text swatches** - text options.
  * **Date** - to add a calendar picker.
* Content fields to add content (no form inputs):
  * **Paragraph** - so you can add content and shortcodes to your product page.
  * **Image** - to add images.
  * **Section** - to group fields in a section.
* Support for themes using "ajax add to cart" technology.
* The product image on the frontend can be changed when different options are selected.
* Set a minimum/maximum allowed number of selections on multi-select fields.
* More pricing options: formula-based pricing, quantity-based pricing, percentage-based pricing, value-based pricing, and character length pricing.
* You can also give discounts (negative pricing) on options.
* Quantity-based fields: repeat fields if your visitors change product quantity.
* Works with page/product builders like Elementor, Oxygen, and Divi.
* Variable builder for more complex pricing possibilities.
* More options to attach one field group to multiple products at once (via product name, variation or category).
* Support for multilingual stores through WPML or Polylang.
* Works with your WooCommerce tax settings.
* Support for multi-currency stores via the WOOCS plugin.
* More integrations with other plugins (such as WooCommerce Subscriptions) & popular themes. [See here](https://www.studiowombat.com/knowledge-base/which-plugins-and-themes-are-compatible-with-advanced-product-fields-for-woocommerce/).
* More options for text fields: min. and max. length, or HTML validation (regex pattern).
